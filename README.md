Marketing Analysis:

I also found while digging that advertising usually hits 90% of those who view it and it would be a matter of getting the advertisement in their sub-conscience for that person to pursue the advertisement . A Solid combination with majority advertising in the higher foot traffic area is ideal due to the lack of interest people have on internet advertisements. So lower cost visual hard paper or audio advertisements would be ideal to win the customer over since mostly the younger generation or the older generation are easily influenced by basic advertisements.

Also seems that a majority of the target group is white it would be smart to target smaller demographics to capture nitch groups of the demographics maybe adding specific restaurants next to larger wholesale or retail stores that generate large foot traffic.
